***Regular Function

function dec(){
    
}

***Arrow Function

dec=()=>{

}

we dont need curly brackets if we doing it for one expression 
in arrow function the same result we get by typing few codes of lines and 
its easy to use and readable,
in regular functions we need arguments and in arrow functions arguments not defined.
in regular function you need to return any value and in arrow we can skip this
